<br>
<p> My name is Michael John Andersen.</p>
<p> If you are reading this, you are most likely a Message Believer.</p>
<p> I understand the apprehension in wanting to get into a discussion regarding the Message and why I left.</p>
<p> Things can be uncomfortable, things could get heated, or I may say something that causes me to "step over the line" and blaspheme the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> That is a heavy responsibility that you are under, as a follower of the Message.</p>
<p> I honestly appreciate your concern.</p>
<p> I appreciate your desire to find out where I stand on things related to the Message.</p>
<p> So I compiled a list of questions and answers.</p>
<p> So you can know where I stand, and you can slowly read my responses to commonly asked questions Ive received. </p>
<p> I hope that this helps stimulate further dialogue. </p>
<p> To God be the glory in this effort</p>

<H1>Questions</H1>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><I> If William Branham isn't the prophet, then who is?</I>
<br>
<p> Jesus Christ. There is no Gentile Elijah promise in Scripture. Hebrews 1 declares that Jesus Christ is the full and final declaration of God.

<p><I> Why are you doing this?</I>
<p> Out of love for Message believers and a desire to give a full answer to those who ask.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><I> Where is your vindication?</i>
<br>
<p> If by "vindication' you mean "authenticating supernatural proof showing that you are the authority to be listened to", I have the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Where is your vindication that WMB was vindicated? You know that if I did an irrefutable supernatural event, you would say that is because I am a "false anointed one". So what point is in asking when you know that you wouldn't accept my claim to vindication in the first place? It is a dishonest trick question. Upon receiving my vindication, would it change your mind in believing WMB is a false prophet? If no, then what is the purpose of vindication in the first place? Don't be a gatekeeper to a property you don't even live on. The true question being raised is "Look at the signs and wonders, this means God is there...and what do you have?" The very thing warned to Christians by Jesus Christ Himself is the very thing Message believers run after. Vindication is simply signs and wonders attributed to God. William Branham simply called these miracles "vindication" and now they are authenticating everything William Branham said. The logic is simply this..."There are miracles ad there are vindications. The way to make a miracle into a vindication is to call it a vindication.
