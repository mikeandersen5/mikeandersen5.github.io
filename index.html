<H1>Questions</H1>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<p><I> If William Branham isn't the prophet, then who is?</I>

<br>

<p> Jesus Christ. There is no Gentile Elijah promise in Scripture. Hebrews 1 declares that Jesus Christ is the full and final declaration of God.

<p><I> Why are you doing this?</I>

<p> Out of love for Message believers and a desire to give a full answer to those who ask.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<p><I> Where is your vindication?</i>

<br>

<p> If by "vindication' you mean "authenticating supernatural proof showing that you are the authority to be listened to", I have the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Where is your vindication that WMB was vindicated? You know that if I did an irrefutable supernatural event, you would say that is because I am a "false anointed one". So what point is in asking when you know that you wouldn't accept my claim to vindication in the first place? It is a dishonest trick question. Upon receiving my vindication, would it change your mind in believing WMB is a false prophet? If no, then what is the purpose of vindication in the first place? Don't be a gatekeeper to a property you don't even live on. The true question being raised is "Look at the signs and wonders, this means God is there...and what do you have?" The very thing warned to Christians by Jesus Christ Himself is the very thing Message believers run after. Vindication is simply signs and wonders attributed to God. William Branham simply called these miracles "vindication" and now they are authenticating everything William Branham said. The logic is simply this..."There are miracles ad there are vindications. The way to make a miracle into a vindication is to call it a vindication.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<p><I> How do you not see that you are falling into the same pattern as the scribes and Pharisees when Jesus was here on Earth?</I>

<br>

<p> It is an easy accusation to make. I believe I am standing on the firm foundation of Jesus Christ and the Apostles. My desire is to be honest and consistent with the Word of God. For me to believe that Christ has come in this generation to "Restore the Word" is to, by implication, admit that the work of Jesus Christ's first coming was incomplete and thus imperfect before the Father. 

<br>

<br>

<br>

<p><I> Why should your opinion even be considered?</I>

<br>

<p> I am a son of God my father, a co-heir with Jesus Christ. I am not trying to make a big show of my opinion over someone else's opinion. I believe that the Word of God as written in the 66 books of the Bible offers a different view of Jesus Christ. My desire is to simply be as honest with Scripture as I can be, and I will answer to the Lord for what I believe in Scripture. 

<br>

<br>

<br>

<p> <i>Do you believe the Bible?</i>

<br>

<p> Yes. I believe the Bible is the inspired, inerrant word of God. I believe there is no contradiction in the Bible. I believe there is no need to add to the 66 books with extra or explanatory information. I believe that the Bible is clear in what it says and is not obscure, in need of a prophet to come and explain something that appears hard to understand. If the Bible contradicts itself, then God contradicts Himself. God works in, with and through the Bible alone.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<p> <b><i>Are you a trinitarian?</i></b>

<br>

<p> If you are asking if I believe in "3 gods", as oppsed to your belief in "One God", I must remind you of your rejection of One God. You believe that there was a light dancing before the Father, and also that the father will be hovering over the son in the millennium. If you truly believe that there is a distinction of attributes or manifestations, yet no distinction in personhood, then you reject whst your prophet said. To answer the question, I believe in 1 God that displays a composite unity that I cannot understand. But this is the mystery that the Bible declares. Yes, God is One God, yet The Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is shown to be God. No other attributes of Gods nature are shown to be God, yet these 3 are shown to not simply "various masks or attributes" of God, but 3 individuals that interact with each other, all while remaining to be one God. This is something that I cannot compare to any thing in my human existence.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<p> <i>Do you believe in Baptism in Jesus Name?</I>

<br>
Simply, and in brief, 

Is it liturgical? If you mean, should the Triune formula be practiced in the Christian ritual of proper convert water baptism, I would say YES. In Matt. 28:19:20, the aorist imperative, “make disciples,” govern the two participles, “baptizing” and “teaching” expressing the means open is made a disciple.              


Problem 1) Oneness folks see every place where baptism is mentioned in Acts, it is a is verbal formula (thus, in the Name...). But there’s not one passage in Acts where this is made clear. Then, according to that unproven presup they then read into Matt. 28:19 a modalistic understanding (i.e., the NAME of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit is Jesus.

3) “Name” as you imply, Yes, in a sematic context—“the authority of the person” (Moulton and Milligan; see Gen. 11:4; 1 Sam 17:45 and Acts 4:7: “By what power, or in what name [onoma], have you done this?”). So in Acts, the phrase “In/on/upon the name of Lord/Jesus/Jesus Christ” (never stated the same way in the recorded baptisms in Acts), may be denoting the “KIND” or type of baptism (in the authority/power of Jesus), and not a verbal “in the name of Jesus” formula—as the term shem/onoma denotes in both the OT and NT.      

4) Of the relatively few recorded baptisms in Acts, not at one place do we find a clear command of a “verbal” formula. Also in every recorded baptism in Acts, the command was in direct address to particular an individual(s). Whereas in Matt. 28 the commission given was to the ones performing the action in reference to panta ta ethnē—“all the nations. The Oneness advocate is insist on a verbal formula then one what hermeneutical standard would Matt. 28:19 not be a verbal formula?   

Although, I am not saying that a “in the name of Jesus” verbal formula is impossible in Acts, but the burden of proof is on the Oneness person to show this as true and show why the Triune formula is not a verbal formula. The Oneness advocate would also have to account the fact that early church indeed baptized in the Triune formula—it’s a matter of record.

5) Lastly, even if you could show exegetically that a “in the name of Jesus” formula was a verbal one, It does not in any way, shape, of form show that Jesus is the Father.




38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call (Acts 2: 38, 39).
For WMB salvation is a three step process, repentance, baptism in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and baptism with the Holy Spirit. He illustrated it as picking up a glass, cleaning the glass and the filling of said glass.1387
according to WMB, you are only potentially saved. You are not yet converted until you have received the Holy Spirit. How true is that statement? In the Acts 2 passage, 3,000 people that heard and received Peter’s message, were baptized and were saved. There is nothing said they should expect tongues of fire coming upon them. The Bible says they were saved, not just potentially. A number of the disciples had already received the Holy Spirit when Jesus breathed on them (Jn 20: 22). They had not as yet been endued with power to witness, which had been promised to them. As seen in the quote below, Jesus said He was given ALL authority and He gave His disciples authority. He promised to be with them as they went forth in that authority, teaching and baptizing in the authority of (In the Name of) the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen (Matt. 28: 18-20).
The following Scripture verse shows that Jesus sent them out and told them that those who believed and were baptized would be saved. He gave them authority (In the Name of...) to cast out demons.
15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. 19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God (Mk. 16: 15-19).
Again, Jesus sends the Promise of His Father upon them, but tells the disciples to wait until they receive the power to witness:
46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 48 And ye are witnesses of these things. 49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. 50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them (Lu. 24: 46-50).
Here Jesus repeats what was already said in other passages. They will receive power to be witnesses:
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1: 8). Lastly, the fulfillment of what Jesus promise is seen in the powerful witness of his disciples in a multitude of languages people could understand. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance (Acts 2: 4 ff).
Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing in these passages that says there is some kind of magic in the Name of Jesus. People do all sorts of gymnastics and jump six feet up off the platform and shout at the top of their lungs, “In the Name of Jesus,” without having any authority. Paul tells the Corinthians, “We are ambassadors for Christ…” (2 Cor. 5: 20). Ambassadors are representatives that have received authority to speak for a King or a Government. When a US ambassador speaks to the government of another nation, it is the President speaking. If that ambassador would yell and jump up in the air he would lose all credibility. His authority is not measured in decibels or performance; it is vested in the President. When the ambassador speaks he really is saying, “I speak by the power vested in me by the President of the United States of America.” He could use a shortcut and say, “In the Name of the President,” and all would know what he meant. So it was with the disciples Christ authorized Jesus said that they had the power and authority of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit to do what He commanded them. When one reads the history of the church in Acts, Luke shows the disciples using a “shortcut.” Perhaps it was Luke using “shorthand.” Either Luke, or the baptizers, evidently did not follow a particular protocol. They did everything by Jesus’ authority, or “In Jesus’ Name”:

1. Acts 8: 16 “(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 17Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.”
2. Acts 8: 38 “[Philip]commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.” No details as to how and no mention of the Holy Spirit.
3. Acts 9: 17 “Ananias…said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. 18And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.”
4. Acts 10: 46 “For they heard them [Cornelius & Co.] speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, 47Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? 48And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.”
5. Acts 16: 15 “[Lydia] was baptized.” No details as to how. 6. Acts 16: 33 Philippian Jailer & Co. were baptized. No details as to how.
7. Acts 18: 8 “Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.” 
8. Acts 19: 5 “When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.” 

The Book of Acts, is not a book of specific doctrinal instruction, nor is it an Apostolic epistle to the Church. It is a history of what the Apostles did in the power of the Holy Spirit. Of all the above listed accounts we see that Luke has none of the Apostles and Evangelists reciting a specific “formula.” Luke simply recorded that people were baptized, as Jesus had commanded. When reference to the Lord was made, it was simply: “Baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,” or in the Name of the Lord.” WMB made the argument that, “the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,” was not a name. Therefore, WMB said, one ought to baptize in the name of the “Lord Jesus Christ.” In reality, if one takes WMB’s definition of a name, the words, “Lord,” and “Christ,” they also are not names, they are Titles. Even “Jesus,” or Joshua/Jeshua, means, “Jehovah is Savior.” What does Scripture teach regarding the meaning “in the name of?”

And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. (1 Sam. 20: 42a). Would WMB’s argument make sense had David asked, “What is the Name of the Lord?” Don’t try this at home when the police come to your door and shout, “Open up, in the Name of the Law!” WMB’s folly is seen clearly in the following,
At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day (Deut. 10:8).

The question may be asked at this time regarding the name in which the Levites were to bless the Israelites? The answer is found in the following passage: Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, 24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee: 25 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: 26 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. (Nu. 6: 23-26). “On this wise,” indicates that God is dictating to Moses what needs to be said. This is one of the few, if any other, verses in Scripture where God does not “inspire” to write; He dictates exactly what needed to be said in the blessing. Thus we see that in Scripture the use of the words “in His Name,” even in blessing involves more than just mentioning the words and indicates that, “in the name” means, “by authority of.” This is verified by the clarification of what clearly is, not “in the name of the Lord,” which is called presumption, or speaking presumptuously.

When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him. (Deut. 18 22).
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. [Matthew 7: 22].
If to be presumptuous is to presume something WITHOUT authority, clearly the opposite is to speak WITH authority. Therefore, to speak “in the name of the Lord,” is to speak by the authority of the Lord. WMB was well aware that baptism in water was not required to be saved, yet he was very dogmatic regarding the “correct” formula. Incidentally, WMB insisted that the Acts “formula” be modified from, “In the Name of the Lord,” or “In the Name of the Lord Jesus,” to “In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ,” by ADDING one word, "Christ"because there was a need to identify which Jesus was meant. God does not need help protecting His name, something which Uzzah discovered when God struck him dead for trying to steady the Ark. This should have been obvious to one who called himself a prophet of God. Therefore, regarding Baptism, there is no reason to abandon the instructions of Jesus, recorded for us in Matt. 28: 18-20. As Shakespeare well understood, “A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”
The above argument regarding Christian
baptism is only mentioned here because of the importance attached to it by WMB in connection with the receiving of the Holy Spirit. This, for WMB was the third step in conversion.
So, how and when is a person saved? Saved is the state of having received salvation. The word “salvation” according to Merriam-Webster means, “deliverance from the power and effects of sin.” How does one receive that deliverance? “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house “(Acts 16: 31). Paul says:
28 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. 29 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. 30 And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified” (Rom. 8: 28-29). This is not the time and place to go into a theological debate over these two verses.  They are simply used to demonstrate that in the progression of Paul, from earth to glory, there is nothing said about the Baptism of the Holy Spirit from the stage of, “those he justified” to those he “also glorified.” In other words, in Paul’s theology of salvation, once a person is justified, that person is saved from that moment on into eternity, without any mention of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Thus, the question must be asked, “What is this Baptism of the Holy Spirit?” This exact phrase is not found in Scripture, though we see John the Baptist telling his converts that, “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me…he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire” (Matt 3: 11; Cf. Mk. 1: 18, Lu. 3: 16). John the Baptist preached repentance and he told the people, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias” (Jn. 1: 23). Regarding the Lord, John said, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world” (Jn. 1: 29) and told the crowd, “And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost (Jn. 1: 33). In other words, Jesus is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is the Seal believers receive after they repent, believe and are baptized,1398 God, signifying the down payment of the Promise of which is eternal life. The NT accounts indicate that upon baptism in water, believers received the Holy Spirit, a simultaneous occurrence. There is no question that this does not always occur that way today. That, however, is not because the Scripture is not true, nor because the Lord is not true to His Word. When the Gospel is preached and sinners truly repent of their sin and believe, they do receive the Holy Spirit. The sign gifts of the Book of Acts might not manifest as they did then, but that does not nullify the power of God. Today, like then, the evidence of the Holy Spirit is a changed life and a person’s surrender to the will and commands of God. The Apostle Paul asks the question, “Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? (1 Cor. 12: 29-30). Paul’s questions indicate not all did receive these gifts. WMB appeared to preach that, but it was only part of his message. WMB believed that could be faked, because he typically only looked at outward conformity in dress and lifestyle. The true evidence of having received the Holy Spirit in WMB, and in his followers, is the acceptance of what WMB called the Message of the Hour.1401 Scripture states that, “[I]f any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his” (Rom. 8: 9c). By implication that would mean, in the context of WMB’s message, that those who do not follow his message, do not have the evidence of the Holy Spirit. Hence, they do not belong to Christ and therefore they are not saved? No man knows another man’s ultimate destiny. All any human knows is that those who do not believe in Christ Jesus, the Son of God, in truth, are in great peril of the judgment. It is not a question of any man’s reception of any message that saves, but rather the reception of Jesus Christ, because, “[A]s many, “as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name…“(Jn. 1: 12). In fact, Luke records that, “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls” (Acts 2: 41). “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit” (1 Cor. 12: 13). “That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith” (Gal. 3: 14). Through faith in Christ Jesus, the promised Holy Spirit is received, not through any physical manifestation of belief in any message. Does that mean that the Holy Spirit does not play any role in the life of a believer? Of course, He does. Christians are exhorted to be filled with the Holy Spirit (Eph. 5: 18; Col. 1: 9) and to keep in step with the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5: 25) and to endure to the end and be saved (Matt. 10: 22). In contrast to that, WMB taught that the faith that would bring the Church to glory was contained in his message he was sent to bring. To what extent is William Branham’s doctrine of Salvation supported by Biblical Revelation? WMB’s teaching of Salvation is quite complex, but it has very little biblical content. In the end, for WMB, what counts is that one receives the Holy Spirit. How is that measured or discerned? Believing the Message of God for this hour is the evidence of having the Holy Spirit. Today, that evidence is seen in following the message of WMB. To no extent is William Branham’s doctrine of Salvation supported by Biblical Revelation.
