<br>
<p> My name is Michael John Andersen.</p>
<p> If you are reading this, you are most likely a Message Believer.</p>
<p> I understand the apprehension in wanting to get into a discussion regarding the Message and why I left.</p>
<p> Things can be uncomfortable, things could get heated, or I may say something that you believe would cause me to "step over the line" and blaspheme the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> That is a heavy responsibility that you are under, as a follower of the Message.</p>
<p> I honestly appreciate your concern.</p>
<p> I appreciate your desire to find out where I stand on things related to the Message.</p>
<p> I have compiled a list of questions and answers.</p>
<p>  You can see where I am coming from Biblically, and you can  review my responses to commonly asked questions Ive received. </p>
<p> I hope that this helps stimulate further dialogue. </p>
<p> To God be the glory in this effort</p>

<H1>Questions</H1>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p><I> If William Branham isn't the prophet, then who is?</I>
<br>
<p> Jesus Christ. There is no Gentile Elijah promise in Scripture. Hebrews 1 declares that Jesus Christ is the full and final declaration of God.

<p><I> Why are you doing this?</I>
<p> Out of love for Message believers and a desire to give a full answer to those who ask.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><I> Where is your vindication?</i>
<br>
<p> If by "vindication' you mean "authenticating supernatural proof showing that you are the authority to be listened to", I have the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Where is your vindication that WMB was vindicated? You know that if I did an irrefutable supernatural event, you would say that is because I am a "false anointed one". So what point is in asking when you know that you wouldn't accept my claim to vindication in the first place? It is a dishonest trick question. Upon receiving my vindication, would it change your mind in believing WMB is a false prophet? If no, then what is the purpose of vindication in the first place? Don't be a gatekeeper to a property you don't even live on. The true question being raised is "Look at the signs and wonders, this means God is there...and what do you have?" The very thing warned to Christians by Jesus Christ Himself is the very thing Message believers run after. Vindication is simply signs and wonders attributed to God. William Branham simply called these miracles "vindication" and now they are authenticating everything William Branham said. The logic is simply this..."There are miracles ad there are vindications. The way to make a miracle into a vindication is to call it a vindication.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><I> How do you not see that you are falling into the same pattern as the scribes and Pharisees when Jesus was here on Earth?</I>
<br>
<p> It is an easy accusation to make. I believe I am standing on the firm foundation of Jesus Christ and the Apostles. My desire is to be honest and consistent with the Word of God. For me to believe that Christ has come in this generation to "Restore the Word" is to, by implication, admit that the work of Jesus Christ's first coming was incomplete and thus imperfect before the Father. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><I> Why should your opinion even be considered?</I>
<br>
<p> I am a son of God my father, a co-heir with Jesus Christ. I am not trying to make a big show of my opinion over someone else's opinion. I believe that the Word of God as written in the 66 books of the Bible offers a different view of Jesus Christ. My desire is to simply be as honest with Scripture as I can be, and I will answer to the Lord for what I believe in Scripture.  
<br>

<br>



<p> <i>Are you a trinitarian?</i>
<br>
<p> If you are asking if I believe in "3 gods", as oppsed to your belief in "One God", I must remind you of your rejection of One God. You believe that there was a light dancing before the Father, and also that the father will be hovering over the son in the millennium. If you truly believe that there is a distinction of attributes or manifestations, yet no distinction in personhood, then you reject whst your prophet said. To answer the question, I believe in 1 God that displays a composite unity that I cannot understand. 
<br>
