- Joined a Christian punk rock band
- Heard about the Message of the Hour 

<p>In September of 1999, I was helping my dad build a barn on the property. An old friend of Dad's came up to visit, they called him 'the preacher' in High School. His name was Bill. This man was a personal softball coach. I was just home from a 3 month road trip with my musical group where we had played in numerous states, and also in a place called 'Cornerstone Festival' in Tennesee(?). Bill and I struck up a conversation regarding the local events that had happened at the Atascadero Bible Church where Pastor Tom was preaching on 'The Innerancy of Scripture', a woman stood up and began questioning him on the Apocrypha and why ws it not included in the canon of the Bible. He told the lady that he would gladly speak to her about that topic after he finished the preaching of his sermon. I had never seen something like that, it was intense and the vibe was pretty spooky. I asked Bill's opinion about it, and I asked him about 'what about women not being allowed to speak in church but wait until they get home and ask their husbands'. He went into a direction I wasn't expecting, and it fascinated me. He began speaking about the original sin, and why women are under a differernt covenant. I then spoke to him about the apple in the garden and that it was Eve's choice to partake of the fruit, and then he asked me 'How can a fruit cause the downfall of mankind?' I was intrigued. </p>

<p> He then told me about the Serpent beng an upright being before the fall, because God said 'upon your belly<b> you shall go,</b> and dust...' thus implying that he had been an upright being.</p>

<p> I had to know more, and he told me the original sin. It was sex. Not only sex, but because of sex, a child was born with the evil genes of the Serpent himself, Satan incarnate. I was hooked. It was 'a revelation' he told me, I needed to know more of the ramifications of this act in the garden. I knew that it couldnt be something as simple and fairy tale-ish as an apple, or an apricot. It wasn't the apple in the tree, it was the "pair on the ground". 

<p>Because of this sin line being created, mankind grew more and more hybrid, and this was why the flood of Noah wiped out the entire human race, because they were serpent seed hybrids. After the flood, every one looked alike and had no distinguishable features that earmarked their diabolical pedigree, except for one thing, the acceptance of rejection of the Word for their hour. </p>

<p>The Word for your hour', was a new concept that I had never heard of before.</p>

I didn't understand what Bill was talking about. Wasn't Jesus enough? Wasn't the Bible complete? Wasn't the canon closed? What more is there to come that I must accept? I believe that I was saved by Jesus when I asked Him into my heart, of course, I was a general Baptist, therefore I had asked Him about 123 times in the course of my walk with Jesus from 6 yers old to 19 years old. I wasn't aware of the ordo salutus and the soverignty of God in His election yet. I needed to know more about this doctrine of the Serpent Seed, and the ripple effects throughout the Bible. So I asked Bill if he had any good preaching tapes, or teaching tapes. Well, when someone asks a Message Believer for teaching tapes, they are asking the 'right question'. Bill was glad to have me come over and borrow some of his teaching tapes by a guy named 'William Brennan' or something, I didn't know or care, I was just interested i the Serpent Seed doctrine. Bill did a lot of talking, and I couldn't catch most of what he was saying. He spoke of Clouds, Vindication, The True interpretation of Scripture, Prophets, Seven Church Ages, Seven Seals, 1st 2nd3rd Pulls, The Church and the Bride, Chickens and Eagles, The Trinity, Baptism, and a myriad of other mysteries that were supposed to be unveiled by Jesus through a 7th Angel of Revelation, and a promised Elijah restoration prophet of Malachi 4 and Matthew 17:11, and Matthew 11. I just wanted to hear about Serpent Seed and really didn't have any interest in any other doctrine or idea but to hear more about Serpent Seed. So he gave me a coupe tapes, the first one was called 'The Seed is Not Heir with the Shuck', the second one was called 'Life Story 1959', and the third one was called 'Marraige and Divorce 1965'. I remember listening to marraige and divorce on the way to a music gig with my band. i was laughing because it was so absurd, filled with logical fallacies and flat untrue statements yet pulled from the Bible in some weird way. His only defense was 'you may not believe me, but its the truth' as if this response was the end all defense of the faith. it is so funny looking back seeing how absurdly biased he was towards women, not towards women, but he was angry about his feelings toward women. because of william branham's feelings towards women, he imposed his insecurities on millions of otherwise sexually healthy men, and made them conscious of things that they wouldn't have been affected by otherwise. Then they blame their sexual issues on the world around them, which fuels their sick worldview which amplifies sexual issues waaay more than what they understood before they were in the message. 

The doctrine of the Serpent Seed 'awakens love before its time' and can do much psycological damage to a child. They are introduced very early to sex, and it has been the cause for a disaster in many homes, sexual abuse is rampant, incest is rampant, child molestation, and pastor hush ups. This is because the immune system in their spiritual bodies is shot, and they are suceptable to doctrinal and physical compromises. 

The Godhead:

The reason I changed from my Trinitarian stance to Oneness was because it made more sense to me. I was a big fan of Jesus being God in flesh. I loved saying that before the Message came along. God became flesh. Jesus was God in flesh. Jesus is God. I was so big of a fan of Jesus being God that I think I under emphasized His humanity. But the Message has a tendency of grabbing hold of pre-infused sentements and leanings of the naieve and biblically ignorant, so many times the transition into the message isnt hard. Or if it is hard, the pre-infused sentements give them an anchoring effect that guides them through to the promised land as they manage to swallow down other message foolishness. Every message believer has a tie post doctrine that you can get from them if you ask them their testimony. Some people came to the message because 'They refer to the Bible as THE WORD', or something like 'I always loved Eagles' or something stupid like 'They call eachother brother/sister'. There can be myriads of cogntive reasons that people join the message though they dress their reason up in evening clothes called 'It was a revelation' or 'God led me to this' or 'I just know that I know that i know that I know'

The anchoring sentiment that got me to believe the Godhead in the way that WMB taught it was simple. Jesus was God, this is the revelation, Jesus is God....the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Jesus of the New" 'Not the first, second, third, or fourth (to give a hyperbolic strawman idiocy of the trinity doctrine) person in the Godhead....the ONLY person in the Godhead. All that God was He poured into Christ, and all that Christ was He poured into the Church. So to believe in the right version of the Godhead, is to believe in the right version of what it means to have Christ in you the hope of Glory. And to have THAT revelation is a lot better than to have some 1/3 of God somehow in you, yet the father is in you, yet the Holy Ghost is in you...Just make it simple...just make it ALL Jesus! The great creator became my saviour, and All of Gods fullness dwells in Him. And of course the Baptism in the name of JEsus Christ was next and logical step. If Jesus is God, and Jesus is the name of God, then why woud I not want to take His wonderful name in Baptism? Was I saved? yes. But I was asked something in the waters of baptism that night at the Fluitts house. "Do you repent of your sins?" I nodded yes. I didnt quite understand at the time, but I was in essence acknowledging that my sins weren't remitted until I took that step of Baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, not titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost. Titles dont save, the name saves. I might as well been baptised in the name of Winnie the Pooh if I wasnt going to accept the name of JEsus Christ in Baptism. So obviously I chose to do this. I still didn't really know about the whole William Branham thing, and I felt bad that I was accepting the Baptism that William Branham preached but I still didn't accept his full message. But my reasoning was that if William Branham pointed me to the Bible, then it must be in the Bible before I accept it. Of course if William Branham makes up a contorted doctrine and loosely points to a scripture reference, guess what? its in the Word. that was simple. 

What I didn't realize about this bullet proof version of the Godhead was that it was wrong, and was condemned by many councils early in the Christian church. Why in the world would anyone want to reject the monotheistic version of God? Why would I want to reject Deuteronomy 6:4? Why would I want to look at Isaiah 40 and view God as anything else but ONE God? Easy, because it was pushed forward by pagans under Roman mythology. And um. they wanted to blind the people to the truth of God in you, yeah...and um then the bad guys killed the good guys and then the good guys went to Nicaea and got overturned by the bad guys...yeah! Really? You uneducated retard. Look at the 20 topics that they covered you stupid jackass. 

There was homoousious, homoiousious, and hetroousious which means nothing to 95 percent of message preachers, forget about laity that has been nico'ed all over....


Regarding the Malachi 4 Elijah Ministry

Where did all the cool doctrines come from? Serpent Seed? God head? And who has the truth-uth-uth? In the maze of Churianity and the myriad of denominations, who had the right way? Will the real Jesis please stand up? And of course, no one was asking that question. No one was wise enough, smart enough, had eagle eye vision enough to look across the landscape of christianity and say 'hey, which one is right?' the athiests do it, and I had struggled with Athiesm a few years before. Athiesm had answers that the Church wasn't providing. 
Another thing, i forgot. 
I remember Bill Hobbes talking to me about all of this. I started believing William Branham simply because I had no other option available, and it really began making sense to me, even though I knew that the logic was awful. But because I was told that faith defies logic, it made more sense to me why William Branham was the Elijah prophet. I mean what is the harm? Every one is looking for the coming of the Lord, William Branham was the Eliah prophet to point to the coming of the Lord, Elijah is gone, he died in 1965, so whats the harm? Why not just see what Elijah said about the coming of the Lord. And so it started with Serpent Seed, then to Godhead/Water Baptism, then to the Elijah prophet ministry. Then I began asking questions about the book of Revelation because that was all a little fuzzy. I asked 'who is the antichrist' 'the pope', 'whats the mark of the beast' 'The Trinity doctrine, or joining denominations'...and instead of going 'WHOA WHOA WHOA' ' said 'WOW WOW WOW'. He began telling me...while all the while 'taking me back to the word...yes, eisegetically. Matthew 25, a wise and foolish virgin being interpreted as 2 classes of people, one class being the wise virgin who heard the message, and got the revelation of what the voice shouting was. then i heard shout, which was supposed to trigger the dispensational coming of Jesus Christ is 3 different stages, a shout voice and trump, even though Acts 1:18 says He will return in like manner in which he ascended. An Angel said that too, and he was there with Jesus as he was going up. But i sat in message churches, and they would say we are in the days of the, some would say we are in the days of the voice and the shout. Some say that the trump was around the corner, some would say that the shout voice and trump and spiritual stages of personal enlightenment in your heart, as if some people have the ears to hear a trump, while others have the ears to hear only the shout and the voice. it all depends how edgy and messagy the minister was. 
 The 'depths of the word' was anytime one could take a verse and squeeze out the ministry of the son of man in the end time. if there was a way to make the bible point to the message, it was considered deep. if lion/ox/man/eagle represented matthew mark luke and john, and the seals book says that LOME were dispensations that correlated with the 7 church ages, then eagle was john, and we are in the eagle age, therefore anything in the book of john has more of a messagey signifigance. parables not elsewhere found in the gospels but found in the book of john are given special placing. sermons like 'the master cometh and calleth for thee'. First the setting is a resurrection, in the eagle season, by the voice of jesus, mary and martha, looking for a future resurrection, yet jesus, in the  ministry of MWB is actually the voice of the resurrection.

WMB vs Jesus dichotomy. 

Ok i get it. WMB isn't Jesus, he was just a man, the spirit of elijah was pointing to the preaching, and the preaching was declaring the word, which was Christ, but not all of it was christ, just the christ parts. and then there is the spectrum of believers that say that WMB was God in flesh to WMB was a restorer of lost truths, and the agent in which the seals were unveiled, Christ being the Lamb who did the actual opening of the seals. i know that message believers dont worship william branham, and i never met anyone who baptised in the name of william branham. That part of the message spectrum is absurd, and i wont even deal with that. My background began as a return ministry believer. Mainly because of a brown bear, tent vision, african prophecy, and a few promised tent meetings around the world, beginning at Mexico City. Somewhere along the line the Mosely Brothers' airplane could have been used, but it wouldnt choke me if the plane wasn't used. Because i could categorize that under a prophet anticipating omething and making a judgement call based on that, as a man. Same thing with 'Before you are an old man, sharks will be swimming around the may company' .

but when i began to see that the tent vision could have been a spiritual fulfillment, i began siding with that. I know that there were outhouses, and other things that had to be a literal fulfillment, but i decided not to stake my faith on an outhouse, so i became main stream message, orthodox message, bride coming message. 

I never got into the WMB vs. JEsus thing, because if WMB was the fulfillment of Biblical scripture, and if scripture said that Christ was coming back, and that WMB was to be the forerunner of the coming 'word', or forerunner of JEsus' corporeal second coming, then

What got me into questioning the Message?
I suppose it was a combination of things.


I knew of discrepancies in doctrine and stories. 
I knew that WMB lied in some areas, but I just thought 'he was just a man'. This brought me to the 'signal to noise ratio' doctrine, and tried to compare his life stories and teaching to people in the scripture. Matthew quoted Jeremiah instead of Zecheriah. 

'Men Moved By The Holy Spirit Spoke From God' (2 Peter 1.21)

So I wanted to be fair to the 'same author' of the Message as the Holy Scriptures. If the Bible authors can have that liberty, then certainly WMB was able to be allowed that liberty. So I tried rationalizing the Clarence Larkin deal under that mindset...I started questioning people like Brian Kocerek, the understudy of Lee Vayle, the chief editor of The Church Age Book.

Brian, my name is Mike Andersen. I believe this Message with all of my heart. I have a question to ask you because of your association with Brother Vayle and the Church Age Book.

Dr. Clarence Larkin wrote a book called "The Book of Revelation" back in 1919, available for free reading on the internet. It has the exact Church Age dates that Brother Branham used. I was talking with someone who said that it was plagiarism. What would be your response? My phone number is 360-224-5713. or just email me. Thanks for your time. Mike

br. brian, those dates were taken straight from this book. br. branham said that he was greatful for dr larkin and his views. my point is that people on the out side would see this as plagarism. though larkin didnt have the full revelation, he was bang on in a lot of areas. you said 'history is history'. but to get the EXACT same dates as dr larkin, who happens to be in br branhams library...to the court system, that is plagarism. my concern is that message believers think that this came to br branham in a vision or something. and many would get choked if they found that it was straight from another source....maybe br brian, i had a prophet of my own imgination all this time, and need to realize like you said "he brought nothing new, he tied up loose ends"...i dont know. thanks br brian.

Mike,
 
Larkins book is very short and has no detail in it, and what detail it has much is conjecture and wrong.


Anyways, This Brian guy is an idiot anyways. He kept using hi credentials from university as being an expert on what plagarism is and isnt. Then I found out that he was a teacher of computer technology. Kinda like Gail Riplingers PhD in Home Economics.

What is interesting is that I was asking

	My story thus far... - 1979 - 1999 - Back story. 1999 - When I first heard about the Message.
I was in a Christian rock band when I was introduced to the teachings of William Branham. My dad had an old friend who came to our house as we were building a barn.
I was 19, and was at a time when I was hungry for the things of God but still had much to learn. I began speaking to my dad's friend Bill about an event that took place at our local church, when a woman stood up and started rebuking the pastor about the Apocryphal writings, and how they are inspired along with the 66 books of the Canon. Bill mentioned that women should be silent in churches because of what happened in Eden. I said "it was because she ate the fruit", and he said "no it wasn't a fruit, it was sex between Eve and the Serpent". Obviously, this caught my attention, and prompted me to inquire further about this strange doctrine that Bill was bringing to me. He explained to me that the Serpent was cursed "upon his belly", implying that the Serpent was an upright being at one time. I was very intrigued, because Bill had woven themes of the blood into the virgin birth and the sacrifice of Calvary into the Fall in Eden. The blood of Jesus Christ had taken on new meaning to me. I heard things such as "It was a blood sin in the garden, and it was blood sacrifice at Calvary". This whole thing was equivocation of Biblical themes of the atonement and representation, but I wouldn't discover that for quite some time. I was too proud of my new found knowledge that others didn't know. Then, I heard of the Oneness doctrine of God, and then the Baptism in the "name of Jesus Christ". Then after these "Biblical" doctrines were brought to me, I began to see that there was an excitement in the voice of Bill, and of the people that I spoke to about William Branham and his 1,100 tapes and books. Growing up in an American Evangelical church, I didnt really hear too much excitement about things of the Bible. I had been born and raised in an evangelical setting, but then went to embrace the Pentecostal and Charismatic Movement that was taking place in my local area. But nowhere was anyone interested in the truthfulness of the Bible. If the Bible was the Word of God, why wasn't anyone excited when they read the yet of scripture? Wasn't the Bible the words of the living God? So naturally, the only time I was genuinely exposed to someone actually opening up the Bible, and bringing forth truth from the Bible by comparing scripture with Scripture, was William Branham. I was actually challenged to read the scripture and see if these things were so. I naturally had a King James Version Bible already, and so when they pulled out certain verses, it was inescapable to me, that is simply what the text said, and why argue? So on November 15, 1999, I was re-baptized with the liturgical formula of "in the name of Jesus Christ".
I recall something that Mike Calderwood said as I was about the be baptized, he asked " Do you repent of your sins?"
I recall already being repentant of my sins and I felt as if this was not just a step in obedience but an actual ceremony that would be the gateway to something.
I still remembering that I didnt have to believe in all of the William Branham stuff, but I knew that I had to do what the Bible said. I even remember discussing with someone in the Church of Christ and they had told me about Baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ, as well.
I remember finally taking all of the books and tapes and giving them back to Bill Hobbes and thats when he told me about what simply the Bible said about Baptism.
The year 2000 rolled around, and I began immersing myself into the Message more and more. I began reading heavily in the Seals, the Church Ages, and then began immediately getting into Return Ministry.
Return ministry is the inevitabl. e
