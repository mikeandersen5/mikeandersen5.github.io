<p> 1) Is it true that one of the named messengers, Columba, was born and died before the supposed church age began?<<

Yes.  WMB said the Thyatira Church Age was from 606-1520 AD.  Columba died in 596 AD.  If that weren't bad enough, WMB has said that the Church Age Messengers from respective each age always appears at the end of his age!  

>>How do MOH believers deal with this if so?<<

I don't think I've ever had a conversation with a Message believer about that!  I did a search here at the forum and didn't come up with anything.  I'm sure they know about it because it's been at my Website for years.  See the page, Controversial Teachings of William Branham.

>>2) With regards to our Lord Jesus' promise to be with His people always, even to the end of the age, would i be right in thinking that MOH believers would, at the end of that 'Age', a supposedly short time span, say that Jesus then was no longer with them/us?<<

WMB paraphrased Jesus' statement this way, 

"'Yet a little while and the world won't see Me no more; yet ye shall see Me, for I,' a personal pronoun, 'I will be with you, even in you, to the consummation, the end of the world.'"
("Who Is This Melchisedec," sermon #65-0221E)

So MB's would believe Jesus to be saying that He would be with them to the end of the world.  Of course, the Message has become so messed up now due to any lack of structure that it was inevitable that new prophets would arise to straighten it all out.

>>Thanks again, hope you don't mind me changing the subject.<<

I'll fix that by changing the title of the thread!
<p> Thanks for looking the quote up John, it's useful to have should that objection be made.

I searched and found this one to support what you said about the messengers coming at the end of the ages:

"58 But I'd just like to give my quotation of what this angel will be, what we're looking for. Would it be all right? [Congregation says, "Yes! Amen."--Ed.] Being that we're got a little time, I just wrote a little quotation here what I thought.
The angel of this Laodicean church, to end it up... Now, he will be at the end of the age, like the rest of them, like the Bible. He'll be at the end of the age. Not the first of it, at the end of it, because the angel always comes to rebuke them for what they done. "To the--to the angel of the church of Laodicea write these things." See?
"To the angel of the church of Smyrna write these things." See? Each one is to the angel at the end of the age. Paul, the end of the age. And on down, end of the age. The lapover, end of the age. End of the age, that's what makes it lap. See, "To the angel," speaking what it was. This laps over here, "To the angel," the end of that age. See, picking up right here, made the lap like stair-steps going up, the seven church ages...

(The Laodicean Church Age (Series) (60-1211E))

 

From that it seems you could read two opposite meanings:

1)The messenger for an age comes at the end of that age to rebuke the church of that age for what it has already done during that age: It all happens during the one age, just before the beginning of the next.

2)The 'lap over'. Could someone use this to say that the messenger comes just before the end of the previous age with rebukes to be heard by the church in that age, but to be acted upon in the following age?

IE: Columba is named for the following age even though he comes in them Pergamum age, just before the beginning of the Columba/Thyatira age? Is the idea that the age that bears his name is the one that follows and lives under the influence of his message?

 

Not unusually it doesn't seem very clear.

 

Did a quick look around for dates and stuff on the named church messangers, and ended up checking on their recorded views on the nature of God:

 

Ephesus (53-170 AD), The Apostle Paul
b.5bc-5ad  d.approx 67ad
implicit/experiential trinitarian (in orthodox opinion)

Smyrna (170-312 AD), Irenaeus
b.115-125 or 130-142  d.approx 200ad
Explicitly Binitarian, with references to the Spirit as being personal and sharing in work of God.

Pergamum (312-606 AD), Martin
b.316 d.8 November 397
Trinitarian - fought against Arians
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_of_Tours

Thyatira (606-1520 AD), Columba
7 December 521  d.9 June 597
Not sure. more looking needed
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columba

Sardis (1520-1750 AD), Martin Luther
b.10 nov 1483  d.18 Feb 1546
Fully Trinitarian

Philadelphia (1750-1906 AD), John Wesley
b.june 1703  d.2 march 1791
Ambiguously Trinitarian, though is not explicitly modalistic. Appears in places to
assume coexistance of persons.

Laodicea (1906-Present), William Branham
b.1909 d.december 24 1965
Sometimes ambiguous modalist/trinitarian, tolerant of both as being incomplete descriptions, othertimes stridently anti trinitarian.

 

 

Hard to see any sure patterns at the moment - some are born and die before the age begins or close to the beginning. Some appear very early in the age (or before it starts) and pass before it is even a quarter complete.

Would lead me to reject the possibility of position (1) above, while the less certain and clearly stated position (2) could possibly be sustained, though how the two can be held side by side is a mystery.

Judging from the times in the above table, if the messenger comes before the 'lap over' to the next age, position (2), we can assume anything from 10 years to over 900 until the end of the current Laodicean age.....
