<p> 1) Is it true that one of the named messengers, Columba, was born and died before the supposed church age began?<<

Yes.  WMB said the Thyatira Church Age was from 606-1520 AD.  Columba died in 596 AD.  If that weren't bad enough, WMB has said that the Church Age Messengers from respective each age always appears at the end of his age!  

>>How do MOH believers deal with this if so?<<

I don't think I've ever had a conversation with a Message believer about that!  I did a search here at the forum and didn't come up with anything.  I'm sure they know about it because it's been at my Website for years.  See the page, Controversial Teachings of William Branham.

>>2) With regards to our Lord Jesus' promise to be with His people always, even to the end of the age, would i be right in thinking that MOH believers would, at the end of that 'Age', a supposedly short time span, say that Jesus then was no longer with them/us?<<

WMB paraphrased Jesus' statement this way, 

"'Yet a little while and the world won't see Me no more; yet ye shall see Me, for I,' a personal pronoun, 'I will be with you, even in you, to the consummation, the end of the world.'"
("Who Is This Melchisedec," sermon #65-0221E)

So MB's would believe Jesus to be saying that He would be with them to the end of the world.  Of course, the Message has become so messed up now due to any lack of structure that it was inevitable that new prophets would arise to straighten it all out.

>>Thanks again, hope you don't mind me changing the subject.<<

I'll fix that by changing the title of the thread!
